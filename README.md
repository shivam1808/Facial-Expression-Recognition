# Facial-Expression-Recognition
This repository contain facial expression using cnn, you can also use webcam as realtime facial expression detection.

## Dataset
for dataset I use FER 2013 from kaggle, you can download here https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge

## Dependency
  Keras
  Tensorflow
  Opencv

# Pretrained model

For keras model you can download here https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6yZu81NrMhSV2ozYWZrenJXd1E/view?usp=sharing and put in keras_model file

## How to use

For real time facial emotion recognition you can execute command: python realtime_facial_expression.py

For detecting the facial expression in image you can execute the command python image_test.py tes.jpg
